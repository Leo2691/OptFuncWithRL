# OptFuncWithRL

##Description
Global optimization with Reinforcement Learning for well-known test functions for optimization.
Project has biuld for the research of applying of classical RL Policy-methods for solving optimization multidentional task (sequence of actions). Classical test optimization functions were used as example of surface for optimization (environment).
Following types os multidimensional functions are supported:
1. Rastrigin  function.
2. Rosenbrock function.
